          <h3>The Service</h3>
          <p>
            Equine and canine physiotherapy involves a skilled and accurate
            assessment of each animal which includes taking a case history,
            static and dynamic assessments, range of motion and palpation
            assessments. From this we acquire a clear picture of how the animal
            is feeling and behaving which highlights any areas of pain/weakness.

            A selection of treatments will be chosen for each case which
            targets the specific areas identified previously. MVP utilises a
            variety of tools such as manual therapies and electrotherapies.
            Stretches and other remedial exercises may be prescribed to do at
            home to reduce inflammation, pain, muscle tension, spasms and to
            improve joint function. Other tools can include electrotherapies
            such as LASER, H-wave, NMES and TENS therapy.
          </p>
          <h3>Setting Targets</h3>
          <p>
            By working closely with vets and owners, Veterinary
            Physiotherapists are able to assess the main target areas
            for each animal and discuss the main goals that can be achieved
            through physiotherapy sessions. These targets will align with the
            owners wishes for their pet and will also follow the prognosis
            from the vet in order to provide the most effective and beneficial
            plan. Targets will be achievable but also challenging to encourage
            personal growth and a successful outcome.

        <h2>
          Treatment is different with each physiotherapy session,
          depending on your animalâ€™s progress and the issues being
          targeted.
        </h2>
        <h2>Massage</h2>
        <p>
          Massage is an essential tool for any physiotherapist. It works to
          increase blood flow to areas of weakness to remove any toxins from
          the muscles post exercise. Massage also benefits muscles as it
          reduces tightness within fibres and can remove any trigger points
          that may restrict your pet's movement. A simple tool like massage
          can be the change your pet needs to improve their
          health and wellbeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Laser therapy benefits pain relief and can promote healing where
          tissues are damaged e.g. from your pet's injury. Laser can reduce
          muscle tension and target trigger points to release these and
          improve mobility. It works to relax your pet during physiotherapy
          treatments so not only will your pet's issues be improved but they
          will enjoy treatment too.
        </p>


<p>
  Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)
</p>
  <p>
    TENS works to alleviate pain by targeting tight muscle fibres and
    trigger points. Sensory nerves are targeted with TENS which reduces
    any pain your pet ay be experiencing. This therapy is relaxing for
    your pet and can result in an increased range of motion due to the
    relaxed muscle fibres.</p>

      <p>
        Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)</p>
      <p>
        NMES sends electrical currents through muscles to stimulate an
        exercise session which results in contraction of the muscle
        which is similar to the contraction during active exercise.
        This modality benefits animals who are experiencing severe muscle
        wastage due to injury and can promote the return this muscle to
        its normal function and size.
      </p>

      <p>
        H-wave therapy
      </p>
      <p>
        H-wave therapy works by stimulating a natural reflex
        within muscles and this works to relieve pain and promote
        healing. H-wave currents increase blood flow to the area
        stimulated which removes any toxic waste from muscles, reduces
        muscle spasm and tight muscle fibres but also contributes to an
        increased range of motion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Heat or Cryo Therapy
      </p>
      <p>
        Heat and Cryo therapy (hot and cold therapy) are two essential
        tools when treating all animals. Heat benefits pain relief and
        stimulates blood flow to an area which would promote healing.
        Cold therapy would reduce the blood flow to an area which would
        work to reduce swelling and can also work as pain relief.
      </p>

            Fitness Plans
          </p>
          <p>
            Fitness plans can be designed for a pet with current
            issues/injuries; this is good for competing horses or
            dogs doing agility or working. Assessing your pets current
            fitness levels and ability will be done in the initial
            consultations and this will be used to create a fitness plan
            that is unique to your pet but targets everything they need.
